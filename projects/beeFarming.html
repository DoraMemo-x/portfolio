              Bee Farming is a strategic game with a heavy focus on multitasking. At its core, the player controls bees to collect honey from flowers, move them back to the beehive and sell them when the market price for honey is high. To get more honey from flowers, the player has to pay to enter better forests, some of which will spawn enemies that kill off bees. Guardians can be purchased from the shop, as well as upgraded with training (unique mini-games that occur simultaneously with the honey collecting gameplay). Basic guardians cannot catch advanced enemies (fireflies), so the guardians have to be upgraded at some point if the player wants to enter a "good" forest.
            </p>
            <p>
              Basic bees with higher speed and honey-carrying capacity can be purchased in the shop. 4 advanced bees can be purchased using money and resources that spawn in the forest, 2 of which offers a training course (mini-game).
            </p>
            <p>
              Both advanced bees and guardians have unique abilities. For example, priest bees can revive dead bees but they move extremely slowly and do not collect honey. The ranged guardian shoots a high-speed sting that kills enemies in contact, but it cannot track and catch enemies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each round lasts for 3 minutes. After 10 rounds, quests have to be completed in order to proceed. Some require the player to enter specific forests, and some require the player to acquire specific bees/guardians. If the quest is not completed in time, the player loses and a result screen is shown to the player with a rating (SS to D).
            </p>
            <p>
              Saving/Loading is implemented so players can save the current session and come back without any loss of progress. Basic encryption/decryption was implemented as a primitive way to prevent casual players from modifying the values of the save file, but it is by no means secure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Bee Farming was an iOS game that I re-implemented from scratch using Processing 3, because the game is no longer on Apple Store and I wanted to extend the gameplay. Having played it at the age of 12-13, I was very invested in this game since there were so much micro-management going on.
            </p>
            <p>
              I intended to release this on mobile. Unfortunately, at the time I did not know much about good coding practices - I hard coded many values, so if the game is scaled up to the device resolution, the bees would still travel in the same constant units, making speed different on different devices. As a result, the size of the window cannot change. It would be difficult to maintain and change these as some code files are over 5,000 lines long due to poor coding practices.
